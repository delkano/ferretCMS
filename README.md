# ferretCMS: another minimal CMS

## Intro
I wrote the first iteration of ferretCMS back in 2014. You can still find it over at bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/elkano/ferretcms
In those days, I was making a lot of cheap, fast websites for local businesses, and I decided it was easier and faster to code a few common things into a microCMS and be done with it.

The other day, I was thinking about remaking my personal website, and realized I could refresh my old concept. Therefore, here is the second iteration of ferretCMS.

## Description
We're talking about a very basic thing here: this CMS only allows you to create a menu, attach some pages and urls to it, and call it a day. The look&feel is controlled by everything inside the */ui* folder, with the basic layout in */ui/layout.html*, CSS under */ui/less/main.less*, and a bunch of templates under */ui/templates/*. 
There's (going to be) an editor for users, pages and menus, some basic configuration, and that is basically it.

## Installation
Quick and easy: upload the files to a server, point the server root to the */www/* folder, and navigate to the server's url via webbrowser. 

## Notes
This is in a very early stage. I'll have a working prototype soon, but this is not then yet.

## Roadmap
 - Basic plugins: I have an idea about this, but we'll see later on
